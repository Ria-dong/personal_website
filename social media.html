								Refer to The social strategy cone, Similarweb (Similiarweb 2023) and Social Media Metrics (Kay 2013), I build this analysis metric for each of the companies.                             </p>
							<p>
								Factors are draw from the main reference The social strategy cone, KPIs include several sub-factors for evaluation as well as the performance. The sub-factors are optimized regard of different company, but all have a similar scope. Scores is the overall contribution of each factors, and comment contains critical analysis and additional information that help to recognize.                            </p>
                            </br>

							<!-- example 1 -->
							<h2>
								National Australia Bank
							</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/social/Picture 1.png" alt="a social media metric for NAB" /></span>
							<p>	
								According to the table, I define target audience, channel choice, goals and resources are the top 4 conical elements that lead to its social media augmented success. Social media it not the main point NAB focus on, however, with accurate targets and very detailed goals, its social media content update frequently and optimise throughout the platforms. With a professional team, public voice has standard tones and monitoring activities. Although these do not reach a high score, I deduce NAB has reached the goals and do not need more effort improving them.
							</p>
							

							<!-- example 2 -->
							<h2>
								Woolworths
							</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/social/Picture 2.png" alt="a social media metric for Woolworth" /></span>
							<p>
								Woolworth is allrounder in social media strategy implement. Among the high scores, I define channel choice, resources, content activities and target audience is the top 4 factor that lead it to success. Woolworth uses its channels for advertising and maintaining reputation very well. Let employees act as an individual rather than using official account to explain and due with customers’ problems about food, services and employment is smart: it can build a friendly image and maintain a pleasant chatting. Qantas replies a lot on its social media using official account, it will be more standard and serious that may not suit the image of a welcomed supermarket.
							</p>

							<!-- example 3 -->
							<h2>
								Domino‘s Pizza  
							</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/social/Picture 3.png" alt="a social media metric for Domino’s" /></span>
							<p>
								Target audience, resources, content activities and monitoring are the top 4 for Domino’s success. Both on social media and on the official website, Domino’s Pizza just aim to attract customers by their delicious food and give them a direct channel to place order. As a restaurant, Domino’s build a chill and friendly atmosphere on internet by using humorous lines and reply to customers’ problem friendly rather than making videos about their business vision and employee’s story. Its customers are familiar and satisfy with the way they operate, which lead to the huge success of social media.
							</p>

							<!-- example 4 -->
							<h2>
								JB HiFi   
							</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/social/Picture 4.png" alt="a social media metric for JB HiFi " /></span>
							<p>
								Target audience, channel choice, resources and content activities are the 4 main reason JB Hifi success in social media. The unique way of posting contents is they hardly say anything about their own brand, but all about the products they are selling. Compare to other companies who produce their own values, this help them avoid many possible legal and ethical risks because all the words they say are “quote” from others. JB Hifi builds a totally different social space which is a silence: customers hardly reply to their posts and they hardly reply.
							</p>

							<!-- example 5 -->
							<h2>
								Qantas   
							</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/social/Picture 5.png" alt="a social media metric for Qantas  " /></span>
							<p>
								Target audience, goals, content activities and monitoring are the most contributed factors. As a flight company, Qantas focus heavily on the “reliable” image of the brand. The timely reply and official tone are the two greatest aspects of their social media operation, they always seem to be helpful and reliable. With frequently check and problem solving, Qantas can monitor and maintain their reputation easily. These unique characters are all based on the feature of the company and the detailed goal.
							</p>

							<!-- example 6 -->
							<h2>
								Tabcorp Holdings    
							</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/social/Picture 6.png" alt="a social media metric for Tabcorp Holdings  " /></span>
							<p>
								Tabcorp does not use social media for promotion and attracting customers as other companies, due to the special industry ---- gambling, it restricts the followers online and mostly use TV and apps to operate. The highlight is their monitoring towards not only their company but also the whole industry. Tabcorp has professional teams with skilled leaders, strict rules and great amount of investment to keep their works legal, professional and let public know this industry does not have that much ethical issues and can be clean.
