								Fleurs Fiction Commission is a self-built website for a virtual writing commission, connecting writers and founders. This project is one of my student design projects for website design and is also based on the actual challenges related to the lack of channels and management for fan-fiction transactions between writers and founders, especially when compared to fan-art.
                            </p>

								It includes a simple search function, a photo gallery, self-made animations, self-written novels, and custom CSS for adapting to mobile devices.

								I have over 10 years of experience writing fanfiction novels. Initially, building a website was not part of my plan. I came across an application called Inky, which allowed writers to easily create interactive novels using HTML and CSS. However, when I tried it, I realized that the appearance didn't match my imagination. I wanted a more complex and refined way to present my articles.
                            </p>
							<p>
								So, I decided to open the HTML and CSS files. I have some experience in Python, but when I attempted to modify the code, especially for CSS, it just didn't work as expected. Still, I yearned for more knowledge and support in CSS coding. That's why I enrolled in a web design course, where I need to build a website, rather than using Inky.
                            </p>
							<p>
								This opportunity allowed me to take a closer look at the entire fan fiction market, where I noticed many writers and founders expressing their frustrations on social media about the lack of opportunities to connect with each other. In certain regions, such as China, posting fiction stories that include themes like sexual, violence or death may be restricted. Realizing the need for change, I set out to provide people with a choice to connect with one another in a more open and accessible way.
